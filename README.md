# LSFM
These matlab code is to provide a computational generalization for different types of LSFM system.

Basic Procedures:

in "generateMatrix.m" file:

1. select and run > run('initial_setup.m')  in line 5

2. select and run > [E0, I0,I0_norm]=complete_field_bfp(k0, NA_ill,N,'Gaussian',1,0); in line 21      

3. run generateMatrix.m in editor

in "main.m" file:

1. run main.m in editor
